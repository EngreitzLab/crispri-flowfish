## Description

To do

## Usage

### Step 1: Clone this github repository

[Clone](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) this to your local system, into the place where you want to perform the data analysis.

### Step 2: Install conda environment

Install Snakemake and conda environment using [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html):

    conda env create --file envs/EngreitzLab.yml [TODO: replace with pipeline-specific conda environment]

For installation details, see the [instructions in the Snakemake documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html).

### Step 3: Set up the Sample Sheet

(Updated 5/7/21)

The Sample Sheet lists all of the sequencing libraries that will be included in the analysis, and describes their relationships and groupings.

Required columns:
    
    SampleID          Unique name for each amplicon library.
    Bin               Name of a FACS-sorted bin (e.g.: A B C D E F). 'All' for input samples. 'Neg' or blank if not applicable
    PCRRep            PCR replicate number or name

Optional columns:

    [Experiment Keys] Provide any number of additional columns (e.g., CellLine) that distinguish different samples.
                        Key columns are defined as such by the 'experiment_keycols' parameter in the config file.
                        These columns will be combined to form a unique experiment key.
                        Replicates for a given unique experiment key will be combined.
    [Replicate Keys]  Provide any number of additional columns (e.g., FlowFISHRep) that distinguish different experimental replicates (not including PCR replicates)
                        Replicate columns are defined as such by the 'replicate_keycols' parameter in the config file.
                        These columns will be combined to form a unique replicate id.
                        PCR replicate counts for each unique replicate key will be summed at the level of this replicate ID.
                        MLE estimates will also be performed at the level of this replicate ID, 
                        then compared according to grouping of the experiment key.
    fastqR1           If provided in the Sample Sheet, overwrites the default value (config['fastqdir']/{SampleID}_*_R1_*fastq.gz)

### Step 4: Provide sort params files

To do.

### Step 5: Configure workflow

[TODO]:  For now, edit `workflow/config.json` to point to the right files


### Step 6: Execute workflow

Activate the conda environment:

    conda activate EngreitzLab 
    ## TODO: Create specific environment for thie pipeline and check in yml file to workflows/envs/

Test your configuration by performing a dry-run via

    snakemake -s crispri-flowfish/workflow/Snakefile --configfile config/config.json -n

Execute the workflow locally via

    snakemake -s crispri-flowfish/workflow/Snakefile --configfile config/config.json

using `$N` cores or run it in a cluster environment (Stanford Sherlock SLURM) via

`
snakemake \
  -s crispri-flowfish/workflow/Snakefile \
  --configfile config/config.json \
  --cores 1 \
  --jobs 200 \
  --cluster "sbatch -n 1 -c 1 --mem 8G -t 4:00:00 -p owners -J VFF_{rule} -o log/{rule}_{wildcards} -e log/{rule}_{wildcards}"
`
